# KOCoSta — Károly Ozsvárt's Coding Standards

## Preface

There are many ways to write code, and the way people write code depends on factors like programming language, functional and performance requirements, and many others.

In this repository, my (Károly Ozsvárt) goal is to document the most important coding standards (i.e., ways to write code in general) I prefer to use.

Warning: This means most stuff here is **opinionated**, but — as always — I try to reason about everything.

## General principles

My ultimate main goal is **maintainability** because that is what makes peoples' life easier the most.

- I highly value **automation**
  - because it helps adhere to standards without external intervention and can greatly reduce the efforts needed for code reviews.  
- I highly value **simplicity**
  - because it reduces cognitive brain load, allowing to work more easily.
- I value **consistency**
  - because it increases maintainability: it simplifies understanding and collaboration, reduces cognitive load, eases troubleshooting, makes it easier to automate things.

## Usability

- Since _everything is a tradeoff_, there are no best practices, only **good practices**.
- I try to present good-in-general practices, but always use your own judgement.
- Always think critically and don't blindly believe what I write.

**Automation**: when configuring automation, always make sure it actually works. Sometimes additional general setup or tooling is required.

## Further practices used in this repo

These are not included in my "general standards", but tailored specifically for this repository.

I don't explicitly recommend them, use them on your own judgement.

**In this repository:**

- I try to **avoid** hyperlinking important stuff from the internet to reduce maintenance cost. Links may break over time but name of concepts rarely change.

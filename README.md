# KOCoSta — Károly Ozsvárt's Coding Standards

## Preface

There are many ways to write code, and the way people write code depends on factors like programming language, functional and performance requirements, and many others.

In this repository, my (Károly Ozsvárt) goal is to document the most important coding standards (i.e., ways to write code in general) I prefer to use.

Warning: This means most stuff here is **opinionated**, but — as always — I try to reason about everything.

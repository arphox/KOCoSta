# KOCoSta — Károly Ozsvárt's Coding Standards

## Preface

There are many ways to write code, and the way people write code depends on factors like programming language, functional and performance requirements, and many others.

In this repository, my (Károly Ozsvárt) goal is to document the most important coding standards (i.e., ways to write code in general) I prefer to use.

Warning: This means most stuff here is **opinionated**, but — as always — I try to reason about everything.

## General principles

My ultimate main goal is **maintainability** because that is what makes peoples' life easier the most.

- I highly value **automation**
  - because it helps adhere to standards without external intervention and can greatly reduce the efforts needed for code reviews.  
- I highly value **simplicity**
  - because it reduces cognitive brain load, allowing to work more easily.
- I value **consistency**
  - because it increases maintainability: it simplifies understanding and collaboration, reduces cognitive load, eases troubleshooting, makes it easier to automate things.
